Unemployment in the US is an ongoing issue with no end in sight, but there are a very wide range of unemployment rates in counties across the US, what can we learn from data about those counties? Can we find any insights that may help us to reduce unemployment?

By looking at a wide range of statistics collected from over 3,000 counties across the US, we were able to glean valuable insights that have the potential to improve unemployment rates in counties with higher than average unemployment rates. We also used multiple different machine learning models to predict unemployment rates in counties within the US, based on factors within our data sets. We were able to identify trends and patterns among our data, and these insights helped us to create machine learning models that could predict unemployment rate much more accurately. This project highlights key areas that are linked to unemployment, and will be worth investigating further in order to determine the best course of action for improving unemployment rates in counties across the US.

So what does it take to predict, or even regulate unemployment?
